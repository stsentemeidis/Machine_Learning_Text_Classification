# Machine_Learning_Text_Classification-PYTHON

Detecting FAKE & REAL news

This is one of my Master's projects on **Text Classification**, in order to detect whether a text along with its title are *real* or *fake*. 

All the files of this project are saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stsentemeidis/Machine_Learning_Text_Classification-Python/).

The work is done by myself and *Ashley O'Mahony*.
